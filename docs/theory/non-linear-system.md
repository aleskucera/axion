# Nonlinear System

This section describes how the optimization problem from [Gauss's Principle of Least Constraint](./gauss-least-constraint.md) is transformed into a discretized nonlinear system of equations that can be solved numerically. This transformation is necessary to handle the complex mix of bilateral and unilateral constraints in a unified framework.

## From Optimization to Root-Finding

The optimization problem presented in Gauss's principle, combined with the various constraint types from [Constraints Formulation](./constraints.md), creates a system that is:

- **Non-convex** due to complementarity conditions
- **Mixed equality/inequality** constraints requiring special treatment  
- **Continuous-time** requiring discretization for numerical solution

The following reformulations transform this into a tractable nonlinear system.

## Nonlinear complementarity

The complementarity conditions in the form \( 0 \le a \perp b \ge 0\) can be reformulated using a NCP-function \(\phi(a,b)\) whose roots satisfy the original complementarity conditions, i.e.:

\[
    \phi(a,b) \iff 0 \le a \perp b \ge 0 \;.
\]

This reformulation turns the original problem with inequality-type constraints into a root-finding one.

Axion uses the **Fischer-Burmeister function** NCP-function:

\[
\phi_{FB}(a,b) = a + b - \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = 0 \;,
\]

implemented in [`scaled_fisher_burmeister_new`](https://github.com/aleskucera/axion/blob/main/src/axion/constraints/utils.py#L27-L45).

Specifically, the constraints that need reformulation via the \( \phi_{FB} \) function are:

- [contact constraints](./constraints.md#2-contact-constraints),
- [frictional constraints](./constraints.md#3-friction-constraints).

The reformulation is described in depth in [Macklin et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04587v1).

## Kinematic mapping

In order to support quaternion-based description of rotation (common for rigid body calculations), a kinematic mapping \( \mathbf{G} \) has to be defined. This mapping transforms the generalized velocity \(\mathbf{u}\) into \(\mathbf{\dot{q}}\) via:

\[
\mathbf{\dot{q}} = \mathbf{G(q)u} \;.
\]

If \(\mathbf{q} = [\; \mathbf{x} \; \mathbf{\theta} \; ]^T \) is a 7-element vector where \( \mathbf{\theta} \) is the 4-tuple of quaternions, and \(\mathbf{u} = [\; \mathbf{\dot{x} \; \mathbf{\omega} \;}]^T \) is the 6-element vector of generalized velocity, then \(\mathbf{G} \) has to be a 7-by-6 matrix.

## Time discretization

Taking into account the kinematic mapping, the simulation update for the generalized coordinates in terms of generalized velocities is:

\[
    \mathbf{q}^+ = \mathbf{q}^- + h \mathbf{G(q^+)}\mathbf{u^+}\;,
\]

where \(h\) is the time step length and the superscript "-" notes the values in previous step and "+" notes the values in the next step. This makes the simulation **implicit**.

By applying the previous reformulations one gets non-smooth the discrete-time nonlinear system with equality constraints only:

\[
\begin{align}
    \nonumber
    {\mathbf{\tilde{M}}\left( \frac{\mathbf{u}^+-\mathbf{\tilde{u}}}{h}  \right) - \mathbf{J^T_b(q^+) - J^T_n(q^+)\lambda^+_n - J^T_f(q^+)\lambda^+_f = 0} } \\
    \nonumber
    \mathbf{c_b(q^+) + E(q^+)\lambda^+_b = 0} \\
    \nonumber
    \mathbf{\phi_n(q^+, \lambda^+) = 0}\\
    \nonumber
    \mathbf{\phi_f(u^+, \lambda^+) = 0}\\
    \nonumber
    \mathbf{q^+ - q^-}-h\mathbf{Gu^+ = 0}
\end{align}
\]

Here, \(\mathbf{u}^+\) and \(\boldsymbol{\lambda}^+\) are the unknown velocities and constraint impulses at the end of the time step. Description of the symbols:

- Normal and friction NCP-functions for all contacts are grouped into vectors: \( \mathbf{\phi_n = [ \phi_{n,1}, ..., \phi_{n,nc}} ]^T \)
- Mass matrix and Jacobians are scaled with respect to the kinematic mapping: \( \mathbf{\tilde{M} = G^T MG} \), \( \mathbf{J_b = \nabla c_b G} \), etc.
- Constant \( \mathbf{\tilde{u} = u^- + h G^T f(q^-,\dot{q}^-)} \) is the unconstrained velocity

Each symbol is discussed more in depth in [Macklin et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04587v1). This discretized system represents the complete nonlinear equations that must be solved at each time step to advance the simulation.

## The Complete Nonlinear System

After applying all the reformulations above, we obtain the complete discrete-time nonlinear system that Axion solves at each time step. This system combines:

- **Dynamics**: The impulse-momentum equation from Gauss's principle
- **Constraints**: Position-level bilateral and unilateral constraints  
- **Complementarity**: NCP reformulations of contact and friction
- **Kinematics**: Implicit integration through the kinematic mapping

The resulting system is a large, coupled set of nonlinear equations in the unknowns \(\mathbf{u}^+\) and \(\boldsymbol{\lambda}^+\). While complex, this unified formulation allows Axion to solve all physical phenomena simultaneously, ensuring stability and eliminating drift.

## Numerical Solution

This nonlinear system cannot be solved analytically and requires iterative numerical methods. Axion employs a specialized Newton-type approach designed to handle the non-smooth nature of contact and friction constraints.
