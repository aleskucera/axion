# Engine API

The `AxionEngine` is the low-level physics solver at the core of the simulation. Most users will interact with it indirectly through the `AbstractSimulator` class, but understanding its API and configuration is key to tuning performance and achieving specific physical behaviors.

The engine implements a **Non-Smooth Newton Method** to solve the entire physics state—including dynamics, contacts, and joints—as a single, unified problem at each time step. This monolithic approach provides exceptional stability, especially for complex, highly-constrained systems like articulated robots.

## The `AxionEngine` Class

This is the main backend simulation class. It takes a static `warp.sim.Model`, configuration parameters, and an optional logger. The engine creates and manages all necessary GPU data structures and executes the simulation loop. The data are then outputted via the `state_out` argument in the `simulate` and `simulate_scipy` methods.

```python
from axion.core import AxionEngine

class AxionEngine(Integrator):
    def __init__(
        self,
        model: Model,
        config: Optional[EngineConfig],
        logger: Optional[HDF5Logger | NullLogger],
    )
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `model` | `warp.sim.Model` | The physics model created by a `ModelBuilder`, containing all bodies, shapes, and joints. |
| `config` | `EngineConfig` | A configuration dataclass that holds all tunable solver parameters. |
| `logger` | `HDF5Logger` or `NullLogger` | An optional logger for recording detailed simulation data to a file. |

### Key Methods

#### [`simulate()`](https://github.com/aleskucera/axion/blob/main/src/axion/core/engine.py#L123-L176){:target="_blank"}

The primary method for running the physics simulation for a single time step.

```python
def simulate(
    model: Model,
    state_in: State,
    state_out: State, 
    dt: float,
    control: Optional[Control] = None,
) -> List[Dict[str, Event]]
```

This method executes the core solver loop on the GPU, applying control inputs and calculating the resulting state after `dt` seconds. The method returns a list of events used for logging and analysis. The main output of the method is the updated `state_out` object, which contains the new positions and velocities of all bodies.
More details on the solving process are provided in the [next section](#the-solving-process).

#### [`simulate_scipy()`](https://github.com/aleskucera/axion/blob/main/src/axion/core/engine.py#L178-L238){:target="_blank"}

An alternative solver implementation that uses SciPy's numerical root-finding algorithms.

```python
def simulate_scipy(
    model: Model,
    state_in: State,
    state_out: State,
    dt: float,
    control: Optional[Control] = None,
) -> List[Dict[str, Event]]
```

!!! warning "For Debugging and Validation Only"
    The `simulate_scipy` method runs on the CPU and is **significantly slower** than the native GPU-based `simulate` method. It is provided as a tool for validating the physics results against a well-established numerical library, not for performance-critical applications.

# The Solving Process

The `AxionEngine.simulate` method orchestrates a multi-stage process for each time step, executed entirely either on the GPU (for `simulate`) or CPU (for `simulate_scipy`). Below is a high-level overview of the key stages in the simulation loop.

## 1. Apply Controls & Integrate
```python
def apply_control(
    model: Model,
    state_in: State,
    state_out: State,
    dt: float,
    control: Control | None = None,
)
```

External forces and torques from the `warp.sim.Control` object are applied to the bodies in the `state_in.body_f` argument via the [`apply_control`](https://github.com/aleskucera/axion/blob/main/src/axion/core/control_utils.py#L67-L100){:target="_blank"} method.

```python
def integrate_bodies(
    model: Model,
    state_in: State,
    state_out: State,
    dt: float,
    angular_damping: float = 0.0,
)
```

An initial "guess" for the next state's velocity (`state_out.body_qd`) and position (`state_out.body_q`) is calculated using semi-implicit Euler integration in the `warp.sim.Integrator.integrate_bodies` function.

## 2. The Non-Smooth Newton Loop
The engine then enters the main Newton iteration loop for `EngineConfig.newton_iters` iterations. Each iteration aims to refine the solution.

### a) Linearize
```python
def compute_linear_system(
    model: Model,
    data: EngineArrays,
    config: EngineConfig,
    dims: EngineDimensions,
    dt: float
)
```
The engine evaluates all constraints and linearizes them, forming a large linear system of equations as described in the [theory section](../theory/linear-system.md). Since we know the structure of the system, we can construct the system efficiently without explicitly forming large matrices, which would consist of many zero elements. This is done in [`compute_linear_system`](https://github.com/aleskucera/axion/blob/main/src/axion/core/linear_utils.py#L82-L186){:target="_blank"} method, which updates the `self.data` attribute, resulting in the following simplified matrix-free representation:

- **Dynamic Matrix (H)** is a block diagonal matrix. It can be represented via one float for mass and 3x3 matrix for inertia per body.
- **Compliance (C)** is a diagonal matrix, represented as a vector of its diagonal elements.
- **Jacobian (J)** is a matrix representing constraint between two bodies. Each constraint can be represented as two integer indices of the two bodies and two Nx6 matrices, where 6 is DoF of a spatial body and N is the number of constraint equations. Rotational joint constraints are represented by 5 equations, contact constraint by 1 equation, and friction by 2 equations.

### b) Solve and Compute Velocities
```python
def cr_solver(
    A: LinearOperator,
    b: wp.array,
    x: wp.array,
    iters: int,
    preconditioner: Optional[LinearOperator] = None,
    logger: Optional[HDF5Logger | NullLogger] = NullLogger,
)
```
The [`cr_solver`](https://github.com/aleskucera/axion/blob/main/src/axion/optim/cr.py#L62-L158){:target="_blank"} method is the core of the iteration. It solves the linear system and updates the `self.data.delta_lambda` (the change in constraint impulses) using a **Conjugate Residual (CR)** iterative solver. This step runs for `linear_iters`. Since the system is represented in a matrix-free form, the solver uses matrix-free operator to compute required quantities efficiently.


```python
def compute_delta_body_qd_from_delta_lambda(
    data: EngineArrays,
    config: EngineConfig,
    dims: EngineDimensions,
)
```
Given the change in constraint impulses `Δλ`, the corresponding change in body velocities `Δu` is computed using the [`compute_delta_body_qd_from_delta_lambda`](https://github.com/aleskucera/axion/blob/main/src/axion/core/linear_utils.py#L189-L218){:target="_blank"} method.

### d) Update
```python
def update_variables(
    model: Model,
    data: EngineArrays,
    config: EngineConfig,
    dims: EngineDimensions,
    dt: float,
)
```
The body velocities (`self.data.body_qd`) and constraint impulses (`self.data._lambda`) are updated with [`update_variables`](https://github.com/aleskucera/axion/blob/main/src/axion/core/general_utils.py#L82-L111){:target="_blank"}.

## 3. Finalize State
After the Newton loop completes, the final velocities (`self.data.body_qd`) and integrated positions (`self.data.body_q`) are copied to the `state_out`.

## GPU Acceleration with Warp Kernels

All major computations in the `AxionEngine`, including constraint evaluation, system linearization, and iterative solving, are implemented as custom GPU kernels using the `wp.launch` from the [Warp](https://github.com/NVIDIA/warp) framework. Warp kernels enable highly parallel execution of physics operations, allowing the engine to efficiently process thousands of bodies and constraints in real time. Each stage of the simulation loop, from applying controls to solving the linear system and updating state variables, is mapped to specialized GPU kernels. This approach ensures that even complex, highly-constrained systems can be simulated with high performance and scalability.
